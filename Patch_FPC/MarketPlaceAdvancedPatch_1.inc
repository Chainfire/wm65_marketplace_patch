  This file is for you. Place here any code to run it
  just following Applet creation (if it present) but 
  before creating other forms. E.g., You can place here
  <IF> statement, which prevents running of application
  in some cases. TIP: always use Applet for such checks
  and make it invisible until final decision if to run
  application or not. }
